            <dd>The <abbr title="Indian Cricket League"> ICL</abbr> was founded in 2007, with funding provided by Zee Entertainment Enterprises. The <abbr title="Indian Cricket League"> ICL</abbr> was not recognised by the <abbr title="Board of Control for Cricket in India"> BCCI</abbr> or the <abbr title="International Cricket Council"> ICC</abbr> and the BCCI were not pleased with its committee members joining the ICL executive board. To prevent players from joining the ICL, the BCCI increased the prize money in their own domestic tournaments and also imposed lifetime bans on players joining the ICL, which was considered a rebel league by the board.</dd>

    <p class="content">A team can acquire players through any of the three ways: the annual player auction, trading players with other teams during the trading windows, and signing replacements for unavailable players. Players sign up for the auction and also set their base price, and are bought by the franchise that bids the highest for them. Unsold players at the auction are eligible to be signed up as replacement signings. In the trading windows, a player can only be traded with his consent, with the franchise paying the difference if any between the old and new contracts. If the new contract is worth more than the older one, the difference is shared between the player and the franchise selling the player. There are generally three trading windows—two before the auction and one after the auction but before the start of the tournament. Players cannot be traded outside the trading windows or during the tournament, whereas replacements can be signed before or during the tournament. </p>
